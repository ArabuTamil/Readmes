<h1>About The Developer</h1>

I'm Mohamed Ibrahim Ansari. I belongs to one of Ancient Islamic Towns [KayalPattinam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kayalpatnam). I'm Interested about curious about Learning history, socio-economic impacts due to different types of culture and heritages. I got the oppurtunity to do this project as my friend [Anees Ahmed] wanted to do this. 

I started by researching about [Arwi-Script](https://github.com/ArabuTamil/Readmes/blob/main/Arwi.md), I searched if anyone has done this before. I found no results but a person tried to do for [Jawi Script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jawi_alphabet). I contacted him and i saw his project in github but that was incomplete. After a long time of researching about making input keyboard for Arwi-Script i came to know that a person has done the research about digitalising Arwi Scripts. He did a keyboard for Windows. After some days i got an idea about doing the keyboard. 

if you need more informations about the project or if you need the source code of the project, you can refer other readme files or feel free to contact me.
